Each of our seven parks is geared toward progression and our rail yard boasts nearly 100 features including rails, wallrides, boxes and bonks. The resort’s hard work and dedication has been nationally-recognized for four consecutive years as the East Coast’s top terrain parks by the readers of TransWorld SNOWboarding and SKI Magazine.Seven Springs’ on-mountain rental center teamed up with Rossignol and Burton to make both renting skis and snowboards and learning to ski and snowboard an easy, fun experience. Rossignol has partnered with only 31 world-class destination resorts across North America to deliver a more encouraging learn-to-ski experience with easier progressions, accelerated learning curves, and a more performance-oriented rental experience. The new High-Performance Skis feature the “Autoturn Rocker Technology,” which makes it easier to steer; easier to balance; and easier to control speed. This technology will result in beginner skiers with more confidence and control making for a better skiing experience. Seven Springs is committed to promoting slope safety. Share the slopes and be courteous to others. Be aware that there are elements of risk in snowsports that common sense and personal awareness can help reduce. Observe Your Responsibility Code and share it with others on the slopes for a great snowsports experience!</p>

			<p>There’s no greater tool for progression, or just having a blast, than a finely crafted terrain park. Nowhere else can you launch yourself over massive gaps or slide triple kinks without doing a single bit of setup work. Simply show up, buckle your boots and hop on the lift.At ski resorts everywhere, terrain parks are getting better every year, and thanks to that, so too are the skiers that frequent them. With improvements in technology and technique—plus an ever-growing interest in building unique, creative park features—park crews are constructing bigger, better and safer playgrounds for us. So, where should you go to throw down? We’ve scoured the continent and found the best of the bunch, the greatest damn terrain parks in North America.</p>
